    <h1>Technology Glossary</h1>

    <p><strong>Optical Disk:</strong> A plastic disk used for removable storage. Includes CD and DVD.</p>

    <p><strong>Optical Mark Recognition (OMR):</strong> The process of reading marks (usually shaded boxes) made on a specially prepared document. The marks are read using an optical mark reader. Output the results from processing data.</p>

    <p><strong>Password:</strong> A series of characters chosen by the user that are used to check the identity of the user when they require access to an ICT system.</p>

    <p><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format):</strong> Used with a particular piece of applications software for viewing documents. This file format is used by the software Adobe Acrobat. This file format is popular because the software used to view the files is widely available and free.</p>

    <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Data about a living identifiable person which is specific to that person.</p>

    <p><strong>Phablet:</strong> A large phone that has the appearance of a small tablet computer.</p>

    <p><strong>Pharming:</strong> Malicious programming code is stored on a computer. Any users who try to access a website which has been stored on the computer will be re-directed automatically by the malicious code to a bogus website and not the website they wanted. The fake or bogus website is often used to obtain passwords or banking details so that these can be used fraudulently.</p>

    <p><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulently trying to get people to reveal usernames, passwords, credit card details, account numbers, etc., by pretending to be from a bank, building society, or credit card company. Emails are sent asking recipients to reveal their details.</p>

    <p><strong>PIN (Personal Identification Number):</strong> A secret number that needs to be keyed in to gain access to an ATM or to pay for goods/services using a credit/debit card.</p>

    <p><strong>Piracy:</strong> The process of illegally copying software.</p>

    <p><strong>Pixel:</strong> A single point in a graphics element or the smallest dot of light that can appear on a computer screen.</p>

    <p><strong>Plotter:</strong> A device that draws by moving a pen. Useful for printing scale drawings, designs, and maps.</p>

    <p><strong>Podcast:</strong> A digital radio broadcast created using a microphone, computer, and audio editing software. The resulting file is saved in MP3 format and then uploaded onto an internet server. It can then be downloaded using a facility called RSS onto an MP3 player for storing and listening.</p>

    <p><strong>Point:</strong> A length which is 1/72 inch. Font size is measured in points. For example, a font size of 12 pts means 12/72-1/6 inch, which is the height the characters will be.</p>

    <p><strong>Portrait Page Orientation:</strong> Where the height is greater than the width.</p>

    <p><strong>Presence Check:</strong> Validation checks used to ensure that data has been entered into a field.</p>

    <p><strong>Print Preview:</strong> A feature that comes with most software used to produce documents. It allows users to view the page or pages of a document to see exactly how they will be printed. If necessary, the documents can be corrected. Print preview saves paper and ink.</p>

    <p><strong>Process:</strong> Any operation that transfers data into information.</p>

    <p><strong>Processing:</strong> Performing something on the input data such as performing calculations, making decisions, or arranging the data into a meaningful order.</p>

    <p><strong>Processor:</strong> Often called the CPU, it is the brain of the computer, consisting of millions of tiny circuits on a silicon chip. It processes the input data to produce information.</p>

    <p><strong>Program:</strong> The set of step-by-step instructions that tell the computer hardware what to do.</p>

    <p><strong>Proofreading:</strong> Carefully reading what has been typed in and comparing it with what is on the data source (order forms, application forms, invoices, etc.) for any errors, or just reading what has been typed in to check that it makes sense and contains no errors.</p>

    <p><strong>Protocol:</strong> A set of rules governing the format of the data and the signals to start, control, and end the transfer of data across a network.</p>

    <p><strong>Proxy-server:</strong> A server, which can be hardware or software, that takes requests from users for access to other servers and either forwards them onto the other servers or denies access to the servers.</p>

    <p><strong>Query:</strong> A request for specific information from a database.</p>

    <p><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Type of main internal memory on a chip, which is temporary/volatile because it loses its contents when the power is removed. It is used to hold the operating system, the software currently in use, and the files being currently worked on. The contents of RAM are constantly changing.</p>

    <p><strong>Range Check:</strong> A data validation technique that checks that the data input to a computer is within a certain range.</p>

    <p><strong>Read-only:</strong> A user can only read the contents of the file. They cannot alter or delete the data.</p>

    <p><strong>Read/write:</strong> A user can read the data held in the file and can alter the data.</p>

    <p><strong>Real-time:</strong> A real-time system accepts data and processes it immediately. The results have a direct effect on the next set of available data.</p>

    <p><strong>Real-time Processing:</strong> A type of processing where data received by the system is processed immediately without any delay. Used mainly for control systems (e.g., autopilot systems in aircraft).</p>

    <p><strong>Record:</strong> The information about an item or person. A row in a table.</p>

    <p><strong>Relational Database:</strong> A database where the data is held in two or more tables with relationships (links) established between them. The software is used to set up and hold the data as well as to extract and manipulate the stored data.</p>

    <p><strong>Relative Reference:</strong> When a cell is used in a formula and the formula is copied to a new address, the cell address changes to take account of the formula's new position.</p>

    <p><strong>Report:</strong> The output from a database in which the results are presented in a way that is controlled by the user.</p>

    <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> The sharpness or clarity of an image.</p>

    <p><strong>RFID (Radio Frequency Identification):</strong> A reader that reads data from a small chip tag at a distance.</p>

    <p><strong>Router:</strong> (Further description can be added here.)</p>
