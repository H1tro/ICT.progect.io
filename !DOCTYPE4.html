    <p><strong>GIS (Geographic Information System):</strong> An ICT system that is used to capture, manage, analyse, and display geographically referenced information.</p>

    <p><strong>GPS (Global Positioning System):</strong> A system that uses the signals from several satellites to obtain the exact position of any object (e.g., aircraft, ship, car, etc.) on the Earth's surface. Many cars are equipped with satellite navigation systems that use GPS to help drivers locate their position on a map on a small screen inside the car.</p>

    <p><strong>Graph Plotter:</strong> An output device that draws by moving a pen. Useful for scale drawings and is mainly used with CAD packages.</p>

    <p><strong>Geographic Information System (GIS):</strong> An ICT system used to capture, manage, analyse, and display geographically referenced information.</p>

    <p><strong>Graphics Tablet:</strong> An input device that consists of shapes and commands on a tablet, which can be selected by the user by touching. The use of a graphics tablet leaves more space on the screen for a plan or diagram.</p>

    <p><strong>GUI (Graphical User Interface):</strong> An interface that allows users to communicate with the computer using windows, icons, menus, and pointers.</p>

    <p><strong>Hackers:</strong> People who break into a computer/computer network illegally.</p>

    <p><strong>Hacking:</strong> The process of trying to break into a secure computer system.</p>

    <p><strong>Hub:</strong> A hub contains multiple ports (i.e., connection points). When a packet of data arrives at one port, it is copied to the other ports so that all network devices of the LAN can see all packets.

    <p><strong>Internet:</strong> A huge group of networks joined together, the largest network in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP):</strong> A company that provides an internet connection.</p>
