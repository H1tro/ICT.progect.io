    <h1>Technology Glossary</h1>

    <p><strong>Bridge:</strong> A hardware device used to connect two local area networks to each other. The purpose of a bridge is to decide whether a message needs to be transferred between the two networks or just confined to one of them. This reduces network traffic.</p>

    <p><strong>Browser (also called web browser):</strong> Software program you use to access the Internet. Microsoft Internet Explorer is an example of a web browser.</p>

    <p><strong>Bullet Point:</strong> A block or paragraph of text that has a symbol placed in front to make the section of text stand out.</p>

    <p><strong>CAD (Computer-Aided Design) Software:</strong> Software used to produce technical drawings, plans, designs, maps, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>Card Cloning:</strong> The process of copying card details so the card can be used fraudulently.</p>

    <p><strong>CC (Carbon Copy):</strong> Used when you want to send an email to one person but also want others to see the email you are sending. To do this, you enter the email address of the main person you are sending it to and in the box marked CC you enter all the email addresses, separated by commas, of all the people you wish to receive a copy.</p>

    <p><strong>CD-R (CD Recordable):</strong> Optical storage where data is stored as an optical pattern. The user can record onto the disk once only.</p>

    <p><strong>CD-ROM (CD Read-Only Memory):</strong> Optical storage where data is stored as an optical pattern. Once data has been written onto CD-ROM, it cannot be erased. It is mainly used for the distribution of software.</p>

    <p><strong>Character:</strong> Any symbol (letter, number, punctuation mark, etc.) that you can type from the keyboard.</p>

    <p><strong>Check Digit:</strong> A decimal number (or alphanumeric character) added to a number for the purpose of detecting the sorts of errors humans normally make on data entry.</p>

    <p><strong>CD-RW (CD Rewritable):</strong> Optical storage that allows data to be stored on the disk over and over again, just like a hard drive. This is needed if the data stored on the disk needs to be updated. You can treat a CD-RW like a hard disk, but the transfer speed is less and the time taken to locate a file is greater. The media is not as robust as a hard disk.</p>

    <p><strong>Cell:</strong> An area on a spreadsheet produced by the intersection of a column and a row, in which data can be placed.</p>

    <p><strong>Changeover:</strong> The process by which an older ICT system is replaced with a newer one.</p>

    <p><strong>Chip and PIN:</strong> Chip readers are the devices into which you place a credit/debit card to read the data which is encrypted in the chip on the card. The PIN pad is the small numeric keypad where the personal identification number (PIN) is entered and the holder can be verified as the true owner of the card.</p>

    <p><strong>CLI (Command Line Interface):</strong> A type of user interface where a user has to type in instructions in a certain format to accomplish a task.</p>

    <p><strong>Clipboard:</strong> A temporary storage area used for copying or cutting data to and then pasting it somewhere else.</p>

    <p><strong>Cloud Computing:</strong> Internet-based computing where programs and data are stored on the internet rather than on the user's own computer.</p>

    <p><strong>Compiler:</strong> Programs that change the instructions written in programming languages into binary code that the computer can understand directly.</p>

    <p><strong>Compression:</strong> Storing data in a format that requires less space. A compressed file takes less time to be transferred across a network.</p>

    <p><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> The computer's brain. It interprets and executes the commands given by the hardware and software.</p>

    <p><strong>Cropping:</strong> Only using part of an image.</p>

    <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet):</strong> The code used to format the contents of a web page. The file contains properties on how to display HTML elements. For example, a user can define the size, color, font, line spacing, indentation, borders, and location of HTML elements. CSS files are used to create a similar look and feel across all the web pages in a website.</p>

    <p><strong>CSV (Comma Separated Values):</strong> A way of holding data in a file so that it can be transferred into databases or spreadsheets.</p>

    <p><strong>Computer Misuse Act:</strong> A law which makes illegal a number of activities such as deliberately planting viruses, hacking, using ICT equipment for fraud, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>Content:</strong> The actual text, images, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>Contiguous:</strong> Sets of data next to each other.</p>

    <p><strong>Control System:</strong> A system used to control a process automatically by making use of data from sensors as the input to the system.</p>

    <p><strong>Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act:</strong> A law making it a criminal offense to copy or steal software or use the software in a way that is not allowed according to the software license.</p>

    <p><strong>Data:</strong> Raw facts and figures, e.g., readings from sensors, survey facts, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Capture:</strong> The term for the various methods by which data can be entered into the computer so that it can be processed.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Logger:</strong> A device which collects readings from one or more sensors. The time interval between each reading can be varied (called the logging rate), and the total time which the data is logged (called the logging period) can also be varied.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Logging:</strong> The process of using a system to collect data from sensors at a certain rate over a certain period of time. Example: Remote weather stations data logging.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Protection Act:</strong> An act that governs the way personal information is stored and processed on a computer.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Redundancy:</strong> Where the same data is stored more than once, or where the same data is stored in more than one table.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Type Check:</strong> A check to ensure that the data being entered is the same as the data type specified for the field.</p>

    <p><strong>Database:</strong> A series of files stored in a computer that can be organized in a variety of different ways.</p>
